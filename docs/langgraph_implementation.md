# LangGraph Implementation for Flight Network Analysis System

## Overview

This document explains how we've implemented LangGraph in our Flight Network Analysis System, replacing the traditional LangChain agents with a more powerful and flexible state-based approach.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends LangChain with:

- **State management**: Explicit tracking of application state
- **Directed graphs**: Flexible control flow between components
- **Multi-actor systems**: Coordination between multiple LLM-based agents

## Why We Migrated from LangChain Agents to LangGraph

1. **Better state management**: LangGraph provides explicit state management, making it easier to track the conversation history and tool results.
2. **More flexible control flow**: With LangGraph, we can define custom routing logic between different components.
3. **Improved error handling**: The graph structure allows for better error recovery and fallback strategies.
4. **Future-proof architecture**: LangChain itself recommends LangGraph for new agent implementations.

## Our LangGraph Implementation

Our implementation uses a state-based graph with the following components:

### State Definition

We define a `GraphState` class that tracks:
- Messages (conversation history)
- Available tools
- Tool results
- Current tool being used

```python
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    """State for the flight network analysis graph."""
    messages: Annotated[List[Dict], operator.add]
    tools: Dict[str, Any]
    tool_results: Dict[str, Any]
    current_tool: Optional[str]
```

### Graph Nodes

Our graph consists of several types of nodes:

1. **Routing Node**: Determines which tool to use based on the user query
2. **Parameter Extraction Nodes**: Extract parameters from the user query for each tool
3. **Tool Execution Nodes**: Execute the selected tool with the extracted parameters
4. **Response Generation Node**: Generate the final response based on tool results

### Graph Edges

The edges in our graph define the flow between nodes:

1. From routing to parameter extraction based on the selected tool
2. From parameter extraction to tool execution
3. From tool execution to response generation
4. From response generation to END

## How It Works

1. The user submits a query about flight information
2. The routing node analyzes the query and determines which tool to use
3. The parameter extraction node extracts relevant parameters (e.g., airport codes)
4. The tool execution node runs the selected tool with the extracted parameters
5. The response generation node creates a natural language response based on the tool results
6. The response is returned to the user

## Benefits of Our Implementation

1. **More accurate tool selection**: The routing node can better understand which tool to use for a given query
2. **Better parameter extraction**: Dedicated nodes for parameter extraction improve accuracy
3. **Improved response quality**: The response generation node creates more natural responses
4. **Maintainable code**: The graph structure makes the code more modular and easier to maintain

## Available Tools

Our system provides three main tools:

1. **FindDirectFlights**: Find all direct flights from a given airport
2. **FindShortestPath**: Find the shortest path between two airports
3. **AnalyzeAirport**: Analyze the importance of an airport in the network

## Example Queries

- "Show me all direct flights from LAX"
- "What's the best route from JFK to LHR?"
- "Analyze the importance of DXB in the network"

## Future Improvements

1. **Add more specialized tools**: Expand the system with additional analysis capabilities
2. **Implement multi-agent collaboration**: Use multiple agents for different aspects of flight analysis
3. **Add memory persistence**: Store conversation history for returning users
4. **Implement feedback loops**: Learn from user interactions to improve responses over time
